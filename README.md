# Coding_Machine_Learning_Algorithms

In an effort to learn more about the inner workings of various machine learning algorithms, I'll be coding some common machine learning algorithms in python using the numpy library. Much thanks to the book Data Science From Scratch by Joel Grus and the Udemy courses by Lazy Programmer for providing a wealth information and sample code relating to this topic.
